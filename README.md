[ ] Add a second-level section header "TEXT", and under it three paragraphs.

[ ] The second paragraph should be formatted as a block quotation and emphasized. The first word of each paragraph should be in bold.

[ ] Add another section header with the title "TABLE" with data to simulate a game score for the Broncos. Creating a table similar to the one shown below, using both colspan and rowspan attributes.
